# 🐹 Learn Go (Golang)

Welcome to my Go learning repository! This repo contains all my practice programs, examples, and small projects as I learn the Go programming language.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- ✅ Go syntax and data types
- ✅ Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `range`)
- ✅ Functions and scope
- ✅ Arrays, slices, and maps
- ✅ Structs and methods
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Packages and modules

## ⚙️ How to Run

Make sure Go is installed on your system. Check by running:

```bash
go version
```

To run any Go file:

```bash
go run filename.go
go run basics/conditionals.go
```

## 🏗️ Goals

- Build a solid foundation in Go
- Understand Go's concurrency model (goroutines, channels)
- Create small projects using Go

## 🌟 About This Repo

This repository is purely for learning and practice purposes. I'll keep updating it as I learn new Go concepts and syntax.
